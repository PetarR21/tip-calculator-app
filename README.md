## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

I learned how to create custom inputs, like text input with dollar sign or profile icon. Also I learned how to create custom buttons used to select the tip percentage. I also learned how to use React useState and useEffect to manage form inputs and calculations. Also I used React to control the state of the inputs, and to handle the errors based on the wide range of user inputs.

### Continued development

I would like to continue improving my skills, especially in managing state and handling forms more effectively. I also want to explore more advanced CSS techniques for styling and layout.

Also, I would like to improve my code in the future so it is more clean and simple. I would like to use more reusable components and hooks in React, and to make the code more modular.

### Useful resources

- [Number-only inputs aren't so straight-forward](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/nnZS761ngXE) - This helped me style my text inputs.
- [https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2913236/html-text-input-field-with-currency-symbol](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2913236/html-text-input-field-with-currency-symbol) - This helped me with creating a custom input, with icon on the left side, and text input on the right side.
